    """Generic class for a motor with rotational encoders."""

    def __init__(self, port, direction=Direction.CLOCKWISE, gears=None):
        """Motor(port, direction=Direction.CLOCKWISE, gears=None)

        Arguments:
            port (Port): Port to which the motor is connected.
            direction (Direction): Positive speed direction (*Default*: Direction.CLOCKWISE).
            gears (list): List of gears linked to the motor (*Default*: ``None``).

                          For example: ``[12, 36]`` represents a gear train with a 12-tooth and a 36-tooth gear. See :ref:`ratio` for illustrated examples.

                          Use a list of lists for multiple gear trains, such as ``[[12, 36], [20, 16, 40]]``.

                          When you specify a gear train, all motor commands and settings are automatically adjusted to account for the resulting gear ratio. The motor direction remains unchanged, no matter how many gears you choose.

                          For example, with ``gears=[12, 36]``, the gear ratio is 3, which means that the output is mechanically slowed down by a factor of 3. To compensate, the motor will automatically turn 3 times as fast and 3 times as far when you give a motor command. So when you choose ``run_angle(200, 90)``, your mechanism output simply turns at 200 deg/s for 90 degrees.

                          The same holds for the documentation below: When it states "motor angle" or "motor speed", you can read this as "mechanism output angle" and "mechanism output speed", and so on, as the gear ratio is automatically accounted for.

                          The ``gears`` setting is only available for motors with rotation sensors.
