Robot Arm H25
=====================

The example program below is written for the core education Robot Arm H25. It moves the black hubs around forever. Start the program with the black hubs positioned as show in the picture. The robot arm will first initialise and then start moving the hubs around. 

Building instructions for the robot arm can be found `on the LEGO website <https://le-www-live-s.legocdn.com/sc/media/lessons/mindstorms-ev3/building-instructions/ev3-model-core-set-robot-arm-h25-56cdb22c1e3a02f1770bda72862ce2bd.pdf>`_. Hint: turn the EV3 Intelligent Brick 180 degrees around when building. This way the micro SD card slot is accessible.
