Ultrasonic Sensor Driving Base
=====================

The program in this example makes the Ultrasonic Sensor Driving Base drive until it sees an obstacle. When it does it backs up, turns and starts driving again.

You can find building instructions on the `LEGO Education website <https://education.lego.com/en-us/support/mindstorms-ev3/building-instructions#robot>`_.
