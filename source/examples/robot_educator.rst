Robot Educator
=====================

This example makes the Robot Educator drive until it sees an obstacle. It then backs up, turns around, and starts driving again.

You can find building instructions for the Robot Educator on the `LEGO Education website <https://education.lego.com/en-us/support/mindstorms-ev3/building-instructions#robot>`_.
