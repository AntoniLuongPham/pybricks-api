Color Sorter
=====================

This example program for the color sorter will wait for you to hold a colored brick over it's light sensor. After it has detected the color, add the brick to the tray. When the tray is full or when you press the center button (enter), the robot will start distributing the colored bricks in neatly sorted stacks.
