Getting started
-----------------------------------------------------------

This guide shows you how to get started writing MicroPython programs for your LEGO速 MINDSTORMS速 EV3 robots. You'll learn to do so in two steps:

- :doc:`Installation <startinstall>`: First you'll prepare your computer and your EV3 by collecting and installing the required tools. You'll also learn how to turn the EV3 brick on and off and to navigate the menu on the screen.
- :doc:`Creating and running programs <startrun>`: Next, you'll learn how to create a program and download it to the EV3 brick. You'll also learn how to start that program, with or without a computer nearby.

Pybricks Modules and Demo Programs
-----------------------------------------------------------

After you've run the first demo program, you'll be ready to try out the example programs, or even invent your own programs. Follow the menu on the left to learn how to use the EV3 brick, EV3 motors, and EV3 sensors effectively in your programs.
