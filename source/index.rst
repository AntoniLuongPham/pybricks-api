Using Python with LEGO\ :sup:`速` MINDSTORMS\ :sup:`速` EV3
=========================================================


.. rubric:: Getting started

This guide shows you how to get started writing MicroPython programs for your
LEGO速 MINDSTORMS速 EV3 robots. ***REMOVED***

Getting started is split into two parts:

- :doc:`Installation <startinstall>`: First you'll prepare your computer and
  your EV3 Intelligent Brick by collecting and installing the required tools for writing and running Python code.

- :doc:`Creating and running programs <startrun>`: Next, you'll learn how to
  create a program and download it to the EV3 brick. You'll also learn how to
  start that program from the brick or from your computer.


.. rubric:: Pybricks Modules and Demo Programs

After you've run the first demo program, you are ready to try out the other example
programs and invent your own programs.
